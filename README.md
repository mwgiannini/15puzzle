# 15puzzle

The puzzle logic is encapsulated in **puzzle.js**.
Event handlers and initialization are in **app.js**.
The puzzle itself is styled in vanilla CSS in **style.css**.

The rest of the UI makes use of classes from the [Materialize library](https://materializecss.com/).


***To solve the puzzle, the tiles must be in order with the empty square at the end.***
